# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/Logo.svg
    - images/Frame.svg
    - images/Chat.svg
    - images/homeActive.svg
    - images/homeInactive.svg
    - images/programActive.svg
    - images/programInactive.svg
    - images/notificationActive.svg
    - images/notificationInactive.svg
    - images/moreActive.svg
    - images/moreInactive.svg
    - images/pisang1.png
    - images/pisang2.png
    - images/default_dp.svg
    - images/Wallet.svg
    - images/arrowRight.svg
    - images/Back.svg
    - images/maps.svg
    - images/bibit1.png
    - images/bibit2.png
    - images/Share.svg
    - images/dompet.svg
    - images/dialogacc.svg
    - images/plus.svg
    - images/min.svg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Inter-Black.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Inter-Thin.ttf
